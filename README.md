CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL MESURES THE RISK

I want to find the Beta of Google. For that I downloaded the historical prices for Google and Nasdaq from Yahoo Finance, and historical yields for a 8 years treasury bond(risk free rate)

How much the price of a given stock goes up/down compared to that of the whole market;
 
Beta = how risky your portfolio relative to the market;
Beta = just the market risk

In R I can deal with missing values in the linear regression;
 working with categorical variables;
 robust models (which deal with outliers);
 validating the assumtions of linear regression;
